FreeRADIUS
==========

Basic Docker container for FreeRADIUS.

Configured to run FreeRADIUS and expose the Radius port.

Users are defined in the users file. By default there is `admin:password`.

The start.sh script will also take user details from env and add them as users.
Eg running this container with `-e RADIUS_USER_test=password` will add a user
with the username "test" and the password "password".

The FreeRADIUS config will allow anyone to access it with the secret
`testing123`.

_None of this is even fractionally secure, it's just meant for dev purposes._
